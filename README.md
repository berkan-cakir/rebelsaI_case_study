# rebelsai_case_study

(AI) Document Management Endpoints â€“ a case study in scalable API design using FastAPI, Redis, Celery, OpenAI API, and postgresql.

## Introduction
This case study / project explores building a scalable (AI) document management endpoints. Showcasing the design and implementation process of two endpoints: folder insight and document classification analyses.

## Features

Folder insight:
- Provide information on the total number of documents in the folder.
- Extract and present relevant metadata associated with the documents.

Document classification analyses:
- Utilise an open-source generative AI model or OpenAI API for document classification.

## Techstack

- Python
- fastAPI
- Redis (Queue)
- Celery
- PostGreSQL
- openAI API
- sqlalchemy

## Setup

The API and related docker services can be setup with a single command:

```docker-compose up --build```

After running the command, one can interact with the API through the fastAPI interactive docs by going to:

```http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs```

## Usage

See fastAPI interactive docs.

Note that /folder-insights/{folder_path}/get_folder_files_metadata must be called before either Document Classification endpoint api endpoints.

## Limitations

## Improvements

- buckets for data
- rate limiting
- user privileges
- kubernetes
