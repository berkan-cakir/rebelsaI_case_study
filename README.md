(AI) Document Management Endpoints â€“ a case study in scalable API design using FastAPI, Redis, Celery, OpenAI API, and postgresql.

## Introduction
This case study / project explores building a scalable (AI) document management endpoints. Showcasing the design and implementation process of two endpoints: folder insight and document classification analyses.

## Features

Folder insight:
- Provide information on the total number of documents in the folder.
- Extract and present relevant metadata associated with the documents.

Document classification analyses:
- Utilise an open-source generative AI model or OpenAI API for document classification.
